| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Mount & Blade*                            | Open-ended structure, sandbox campaign  | Player builds their own warband, similar to fleet system |
| *FTL: Faster Than Light*                   | Modular ship design, permadeath tension | Possible influence on ship systems                       |
| *Total War: Warhammer*                     | Pre-battle positioning, autonomous AI   | Similar "plan, then watch" model                         |
| *Into the Breach*                          | Clean tactical clarity, systemic rules  | Simulated predictability, minimalist UI                  |
| *TABS* (Totally Accurate Battle Simulator) | Spectacle from chaos, systemic comedy   | Emergent fun through physics and loose AI                |
