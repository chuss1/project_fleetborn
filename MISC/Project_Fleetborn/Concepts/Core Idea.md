_Project Fleetborn_ (working title)

### Genre
Real-time Fleet Combat Simulation with pre-battle strategy planning

### Pitch
You are a fleet commander for your own mercenary crew in a galaxy far far away. You build a fleet of modular star-ships, arranging their formations, and issue strategic parameters; then watch the battle simulation unfurl in real time. Victory is entirely dependent of the player's foresight, ability to plan naval warfare, and create strong ships that will not succumb to the enemies.

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. Buy, Build, or scavenge a fleet of ships together for your crew
2. Customize your ships to fit your needs. From a per-ship basis to fleet wide changes
3. Arrange the fleets formation and assign roles and tactics per ship
4. Go to battle. A simulation of the battle between your fleet and the opponents
5. Analyze the results. Whether you win or lose. You should understand why the battle turned out the way it did

### Why _Project Fleetborn_
- Combines the satisfying experimentation of an _Auto Chess_ or _TABS_ with the epic spectacle of space warfare
- Focuses on strategic depth over micromanagement
- Offers cinematic battles driven by the system and the player's brain rather than the player's physical skills

### [[Game Pillars]]
- **Preparation Over Reaction:** Win or lose based on the planning
- **Modular Design:** Players define how ships function and work together
- **Simulated Chaos:** No two battles should play out the same
- **Spectacle with Substance:** Battles look cool, but every action is driven by the rules and logic
