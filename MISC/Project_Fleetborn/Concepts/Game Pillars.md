# Game Pillars
These pillars guide the design of the game at every level—from mechanics and UI to player experience and visual feedback. All features and systems should reinforce or serve at least one of these.

---
## 1. Preparation Over Reaction
> The player’s power lies in their planning, not their reflexes.

- Players cannot control ships during battle.
- Victory is earned through fleet composition, positioning, and tactical setup.
- Tension comes from watching a plan unfold without interference—success or failure is on the player’s foresight.
### Example Applications:
- Pre-battle formation editor
- Assigning roles or behaviors before deployment
- No mid-battle commands

---
## 2. Modular Strategy
> Players create and command fleets using modular, customizable ships.

- Ships are built from components: hulls, engines, weapons, AI modules, etc.
- Each module adds unique stats or behavior, allowing for creative builds and synergies.
- Fleet variety and experimentation are rewarded.
### Example Applications:
- Design-your-own ship editor
- Component system with tradeoffs (e.g., heavy armor vs. speed)
- Rock-paper-scissors dynamics between ship roles

---
## 3. Simulated Chaos
> Once combat begins, the system takes over. No scripts. No cheating.

- Battles unfold in real time based on simple rules and autonomous AI.
- No player input is allowed mid-battle—this encourages systemic balance and clarity.
- Emergent behavior and surprise outcomes create replayability and depth.
### Example Applications:
- Physics-based projectile simulation
- Role-based AI (sniper, brawler, escort, etc.)
- Friendly fire, collision, and chain reactions

---
## 4. Spectacle with Substance
> What you see is what the system simulates.

- Visuals and effects reflect actual game mechanics and stats.
- Players can "read" the battle and diagnose results through observation.
- Flashy moments are grounded in rules and logic, not cinematic scripting.
### Example Applications:
- Muzzle flashes when weapons fire, matching fire rate and cooldown
- Visible damage on ships that correlates with health or system failure
- Death animations that reflect weapon type or impact force

| Pillar                    | Focus              | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Preparation Over Reaction | Strategic Planning | Prioritizes forethought over micromanagement |
| Modular Strategy          | System Design      | Encourages creativity and build variety      |
| Simulated Chaos           | Emergence          | Creates organic, unscripted battles          |
| Spectacle with Substance  | Clarity + Drama    | Aligns visuals with game mechanics           |
